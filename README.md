# Simplified - Frontend Engineer Task

Using any React meta framework of your choice (f.e NextJS), prepare a simple app which will allow searching trough API's results. You can use any free API of your choice (check https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) to search through anything you find interesting.

For example, it could be a star was characters search app, which gets results from this API: https://swapi.dev/documentation

App should consist of:

- 1 page with search input and search results; results should be clickable;
- 1 page with single result's details;
Pagination on search results is not required.

Keep the visual/css layer simple, focus on the code quality.

Unit tests are not required, but adding them will be a bonus :)
